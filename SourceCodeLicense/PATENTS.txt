                           Additional Permissions File:

   1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this license, each copyright
      holder and contributor hereby grants to those receiving rights under this
      license a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
      irrevocable (except for failure to satisfy the conditions of this license
      and subject to section 2 of this license) patent license to make, have
      made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer this
      software, where such license applies only to those patent claims, already
      acquired or hereafter acquired, licensable by such copyright holder or
      contributor that are necessarily infringed by:

      (a) its Contribution alone; or

      (b) combination of its Contribution with the work of authorship to which
          such Contribution was added by such copyright holder or contributor,
          if, at the time the Contribution is added, such addition causes such
          combination to be necessarily infringed. The patent license does not
          apply to any other combinations that include the Contribution or to
          any other software.

      Except as expressly stated above, no patent rights or licenses from any
      copyright holder or contributor are granted under this license, whether
      expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise.

   2. If You, as an individual or legal entity exercising permissions granted
      by this License, institute, fund, or voluntarily join patent litigation
      against any entity (excluding defensive cross-claims or counterclaims in
      a lawsuit) alleging that the Contribution or open source project to which
      this Contribution was added by the copyright holder or contributor
      constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent
      licenses granted to You under section 1 of this license for that
      Contribution or open source project terminate as of the date such
      litigation is filed or joined.

   “Contribution” means, for a copyright holder or contributor, any idea or
   text submitted by such copyright holder or contributor for inclusion in the
   open source project.
