      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>
            This Working Group will recommend a Web programming interface for
            graphics and computation that:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>enables rendering of modern graphics to both onscreen and offscreen drawing surfaces</li>
            <li>enables computation tasks to be performed, and the results of such tasks to be retrieved</li>
            <li>This group may also recommend a companion Shading Language that describes the graphics and computation tasks in a format
            that can be translated or compiled into platform-specific instructions</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            The API will not be restricted to any particular platform technology. Instead, it will
            be generic enough to be implemented on top of modern GPU libraries, such as
            Microsoft's Direct3D 12, Apple's Metal, and Khronos's Vulkan.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that the majority of the input to this Working Group will come
            directly from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/gpu/">GPU for the Web Community Group</a>.
            No major development will happen in the Working Group itself. Instead, the Community
            Group will be driving the technical work.
        </p>

        <div>
          <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
          <p>In order to advance to  <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#RecsCR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each specification is expected to have at least two independent implementations of each of feature defined in the specification.</p>
          <p>The WebGPU specification should contain a section detailing any <a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/security-privacy-questionnaire/'>known security</a>, fingerprinting, and privacy implications, and suggested <a href='https://w3c.github.io/perf-security-privacy/'>mitigation strategies</a> for implementers, Web authors, and end users. The group should not publish a specification if acceptable mitigation strategies cannot be found.</p>
          <p>The WebGPU specification should contain a section describing known impacts on accessibility to users with disabilities, ways the specification features address them, and recommendations for minimizing accessibility problems in implementation.</p>
          <p>Normative specification changes are generally expected to have a corresponding set of tests, either in the form of new tests or modifications to existing tests, or must include the rationale for why test updates are not required for the proposed update.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Out of Scope</h2>
        <p>
            The scope of work is restricted to the development of a programming
            interface between the Web Platform and modern 3D graphics and
            computation capabilities present on native system platforms. The work
            will not define hardware features or algorithms, and the interface it
            defines is not intended to be directly exposed by a GPU driver.

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 5 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          As stated above, the majority of the technical work for Working Group will take place in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/gpu/">GPU for the Web Community Group</a>.

          Communication

        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>. Meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository, and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/gpu/">GPU for the Web Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most GPU for the Web Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work in its <a href="https://github.com/gpuweb">public repositories</a>. There is also a public mailing list <a id="public-name" href="mailto:public-gpu@w3.org">public-gpu@w3.org</a> (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-gpu/">archive</a>).

      <section id="decisions">
        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional until 10 working days after the publication of the resolution in draft minutes sent, which will be published within 5 working days of the meeting to the working group's mailing list with a 'call for consensus' in the subject line. If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
