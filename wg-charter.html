        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>
            In this document, the term <dfn>GPU</dfn> stands for Graphics
            Processing Unit, typically a piece of hardware dedicated to
            efficiently processing graphics and related features.
        </p>

        <p>
            This Working Group will recommend a Web programming interface for
            graphics and computation that:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>enables rendering of modern graphics to both onscreen and offscreen drawing surfaces</li>
            <li>enables computation tasks to be performed, and the results of such tasks to be retrieved</li>
            <li>This group will also recommend a companion Shading Language that describes the graphics and computation tasks in a format
            that can be translated or compiled into platform-specific instructions</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            The API will not be restricted to any particular platform technology. Instead, it will
            be generic enough to be implemented on top of modern GPU system APIs, such as
            Microsoft's Direct3D 12, Apple's Metal, and Khronos's Vulkan.
        </p>

        <p>
            This Working Group will investigate and document threat mitigation
            strategies for the API, notably to address fingerprinting issues
            and to prevent unauthorized use of computational resources.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that the majority of the input to this Working Group will come
            directly from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/gpu/">GPU for the Web Community Group</a>.
            No major development will happen in the Working Group itself. Instead, the Community
            Group will be driving the technical work.
        </p>

        <h2>Out of Scope</h2>
        <p>
            The scope of work is restricted to the development of a programming
            interface between the Web Platform and modern 3D graphics and
            computation capabilities present on native system platforms. The work
            will not define hardware features or algorithms, and the interface it
            defines is not intended to be directly exposed by a GPU driver.
        </p>

      <section id="success-criteria">
        <h2>Success Criteria</h2>
        <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts. Normative specification changes are generally expected to have a corresponding set of tests, either in the form of new tests or modifications to existing tests, or must include the rationale for why test updates are not required for the proposed update.</p>
        <p>Each specification should contain sections detailing all known security and privacy &mdash;including fingerprinting&mdash; implications, and suggested mitigation strategies for implementers, web authors, and end users. The group should not publish a specification if acceptable mitigation strategies cannot be found.</p>
        <p>Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>
        <p>This Working Group expects to follow the TAG <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/">Web Platform Design Principles</a>.</p>
        <p>All new features should have expressions of interest from at least two potential implementors before being incorporated in the specification.</p>
      </section>


      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/other/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>. Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>. The Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of each specification. The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/patent-policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Participants in the group are required
          (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>)
          to follow the W3C

        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests. The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/gpu/">GPU for the Web Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most GPU for the Web Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work in its <a href="https://github.com/gpuweb">public repositories</a>. There is also a public mailing list <a id="public-name" href="mailto:public-gpu@w3.org">public-gpu@w3.org</a> (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-gpu/">archive</a>).  The public is invited to contribute to the github repositories and post messages to the list. Regular activity summaries around the github repositories will be provided.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

      <section id="decisions">
        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from <span id='cfc'>10 working days</i></span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.
