      Goals
    </h2>
    <p>
      The mission of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/gpu/">GPU for
      the Web Community Group</a> is to provide an interface between the Web
      Platform and modern 3D graphics and computation capabilities present on
      native system platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
        The current practice in accelerated graphics for the Web Platform is to
        use WebGL (as of early 2017). This Community Group aims to produce a
        more advanced technology with the following features:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>An API that maps nicely to modern Web platform design patterns;</li>
        <li>A lower-level API that allows greater performance in applications;</li>
        <li>An API that exposes the GPU computation functionality provided by more
            modern APIs and available on many devices;
        </li>
        <li>A technology that can be reasonably implemented on all platforms
            that have a modern, low-level graphics API;
        </li>
        <li>An API designed to provide a efficient bindings for both JavaScript and
            <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly">WebAssembly</a>, possibly
            requiring separate interfaces for each.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If successful, the output from this Community Group will establish a
        new programming layer for the Web Platform that is more modern, more
        efficient, more functional, better integrated with other aspects of
        the Web Platform, and designed to be implemented on a wide variety of
        modern graphics platform or, in a worst case scenario, in a software
        fallback. We expect most participants of this Community Group to
        commit to a <a
        href="https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/final/"> Final
        Specification Agreement</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="scope-of-work">
      Scope of Work
    </h2>

    <p>
        This Community Group will recommend a Web programming interface for
        graphics and computation that:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>enables rendering of modern graphics to both onscreen and offscreen drawing surfaces</li>
        <li>enables computation tasks to be performed, and the results of such tasks to be retrieved</li>
        <li>defines a Shading Language that describes the graphics and computation tasks in a format
        that can be translated or compiled into platform-specific instructions</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        The API will not be restricted to any particular platform technology. Instead, it will
        be generic enough to be implemented on top of modern GPU libraries, such as
        Microsoft's Direct3D 12, Apple's Metal, and Khronos's Vulkan.
    </p>

    <h3 id="target-audience">Target Audiences</h3>

    <p>
        The <a href="#deliverables">deliverables</a> of this Community Group are
        primarily addressed, either directly or indirectly, to the following audiences:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Developers of 3D and game engines/tools that are producing Web
            content via transpilation. For example, <a
            href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> and the <a
            href="https://www.unrealengine.com">Unreal Engine</a> use <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emscripten">emscripten</a> to
            compile content for the Web.
        </li>

        <li>
            JavaScript framework developers who are building GPU libraries,
            intended to be used in Web content, but providing a higher-level
            API and hiding much of the low-level graphics and compute details
            from their users. For example, <a
            href="https://threejs.org">three.js</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
            Web developers who are competent in GPU technologies, and will want to
            use the GPU for the Web API directly to create content, rather than
            a higher-level framework.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The typical Web, or even non-Web, developers are a secondary audience, since
        they often prefer using a higher-level framework rather than the low-level
        technology. Such developers are an important part of the community, and some
        of the <a href="#deliverables">Community Group's non-normative deliverables</a>
        are addressed to them.
    </p>

    <h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>

    <p>
        The scope of work is restricted to the development of a programming
        interface between the Web Platform and modern 3D graphics and
        computation capabilities present on native system platforms. The work
        will not define hardware features or algorithms, and the interface it
        defines is not intended to be directly exposed by a GPU driver.

    </p>
    <p>
      The group may also produce other Community Group Reports within the scope of
      this charter but that are not Specifications, for instance use cases,
      requirements, or white papers.
    </p>
    <h3 id="tutorials">
      Tutorials
    </h3>
    <p>
        The group may produce tutorial or explanatory content designed
        to help people learn the technical material. For example, an interactive
        tutorial could introduce the graphics pipeline or shader programming.
    </p>
    <h3 id="test-suites">
      Test Suites and Other Software
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Community Group will develop a test suite that exercises the GPU for the Web API.
      Please see the GitHub LICENSE file for test suite contribution licensing
      information.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Community Group may develop a software library that implements the GPU for the
      Web work across multiple platforms using existing native APIs. For example, a
      C++ library that exposes GPU for the Web using Direct3D, Metal or Vulkan. Such software
      will be developed using the <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/copyright-software-and-document">
      W3C Software and Document License</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="process">
      Community and Business Group Process
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group operates under the <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/">Community and Business
      Group Process</a>. Terms in this Charter that conflict with those of the
      Community and Business Group Process are void.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with other Community Groups, W3C seeks organizational licensing
      commitments under the <a href=
      'http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/'>W3C Community
      Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>. When people request to
      participate without representing their organization's legal interests,
      W3C will in general approve those requests for this group with the
      following understanding: W3C will seek and expect an organizational
      commitment under the CLA starting with the individual's first request to
      make a contribution to a group <a href="#deliverables">Deliverable</a>.
      The section on <a href="#contrib">Contribution Mechanics</a> describes
      how W3C expects to monitor these contribution requests.
    </p>
    <h2 id="worklimit">
      Work Limited to Charter Scope
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group will not publish Specifications on topics other than those
      listed under <a href="#specifications">Specifications</a> above. See
      below for <a href="#charter-change">how to modify the charter</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="contrib">
      Contribution Mechanics
    </h2>
    <p>
      Substantive Contributions to Specifications can only be made by Community
      Group Participants who have agreed to the <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/">W3C Community
      Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifications created in the Community Group must use the <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/copyright-software-and-document">
      W3C Software and Document License</a>. All other documents produced by
      the group should use that License where possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Community Group participants agree to make all contributions in the
      GitHub repository the group is using for the particular document. This may be
      in the form of a pull request (preferred), by raising an issue, or by
      adding a comment to an existing issue.
    </p>
    <p id="githublicense">
      All Github repositories attached to the Community Group must contain a
      copy of the <a href=
      "https://github.com/w3c/licenses/blob/master/CG-CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING</a>

      files.
    </p>
    <h2 id="transparency">
      Transparency
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group will conduct all of its technical work in public. If the group
      uses GitHub, all technical work will occur in its GitHub repositories
      (and not in mailing list discussions). This is to ensure contributions
      can be tracked through a software tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meetings may be restricted to Community Group participants, but a public
      summary or minutes must be posted to the group's public mailing list, or
      to a GitHub issue if the group uses GitHub.
    </p>
    <h2 id="decision">
      Decision Process
    </h2>
    <p>
      This group will seek to make decisions where there is consensus. Groups
      are free to decide how to make decisions (e.g. Participants who have
      earned Committer status for a history of useful contributions assess
      consensus, or the Chair assesses consensus, or where consensus is not
      clear there is a Call for Consensus [CfC] to allow multi-day online
      feedback for a proposed course of action). It is expected that
      participants can earn Committer status through a history of valuable
      contributions as is common in open source projects. After discussion and
      due consideration of different opinions, a decision should be publicly
      recorded (where GitHub is used as the resolution of an Issue).
    </p>
    <p>
      If substantial disagreement remains (e.g. the group is divided) and the
      group needs to decide an Issue in order to continue to make progress, the
      Committers will choose an alternative that had substantial support (with
      a vote of Committers if necessary). Individuals who disagree with the
      choice are strongly encouraged to take ownership of their objection by
      taking ownership of an alternative fork. This is explicitly allowed (and
      preferred to blocking progress) with a goal of letting implementation
      experience inform which specification is ultimately chosen by the group to move
      ahead with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any decisions reached at any meeting are tentative and should be recorded
      in a GitHub Issue for groups that use GitHub and otherwise on the group's
      public mail list. Any group participant may object to a decision reached
      at an online or in-person meeting within 7 days of publication of the
      decision provided that they include clear technical reasons for their
      objection. The Chairs will facilitate discussion to try to resolve the
      objection according to the <a href="#decision">decision process</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the Chairs' responsibility to ensure that the decision process is
      fair, respects the consensus of the CG, and does not unreasonably favour
      or discriminate against any group participant or their employer.
    </p>
    <h2 id="chairs">
      Chair Selection
    </h2>
    <p>
      Participants in this group choose their Chair(s) and can replace their
      Chair(s) at any time using whatever means they prefer. However, if 5
      participants, no two from the same organisation, call for an election,
      the group must use the following process to replace any current Chair(s)
      with a new Chair, consulting the Community Development Lead on election
      operations (e.g., voting infrastructure and using <a href=
      "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2777">RFC 2777</a>).
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Participants announce their candidacies. Participants have 14 days to
      announce their candidacies, but this period ends as soon as all
      participants have announced their intentions. If there is only one
      candidate, that person becomes the Chair. If there are two or more
      candidates, there is a vote. Otherwise, nothing changes.
      </li>
      <li>Participants vote. Participants have 21 days to vote for a single
      candidate, but this period ends as soon as all participants have voted.
      The individual who receives the most votes, no two from the same
      organisation, is elected chair. In case of a tie, RFC2777 is used to
      break the tie. An elected Chair may appoint co-Chairs.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Participants dissatisfied with the outcome of an election may ask the
      Community Development Lead to intervene. The Community Development Lead,
      after evaluating the election, may take any action including no action.
    </p>
    <h2 id="charter-change">
      Amendments to this Charter
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group can decide to work on a proposed amended charter, editing the
      text using the <a href="#decision">Decision Process</a> described above.
      The decision on whether to adopt the amended charter is made by
      conducting a 30-day vote on the proposed new charter. The new charter, if
      approved, takes effect on either the proposed date in the charter itself,
      or 7 days after the result of the election is announced, whichever is
      later. A new charter must receive 2/3 of the votes cast in the approval
      vote to pass. The group may make simple corrections to the charter such
      as deliverable dates by the simpler group decision process rather than
      this charter amendment process. The group will use the amendment process
      for any substantive changes to the goals, scope, deliverables, decision
      process or rules for amending the charter.
